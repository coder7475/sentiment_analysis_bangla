ðŸ“Š Imbalance Effects Analysis
=================================
Baseline models show low Positive class F1:
  - Mean F1_Positive: 0.509
  - Std Dev F1_Positive: 0.023

Mitigated models improve Positive F1, especially with techniques like SMOTE and Weighted Loss:

Mitigation                       tuned
Model                                 
LogisticRegression_nearmiss      0.500
LogisticRegression_smote         0.504
LogisticRegression_undersampled  0.524
LogisticRegression_weighted      0.480
NaiveBayes_nearmiss              0.528
NaiveBayes_smote                 0.475
NaiveBayes_undersampled          0.523
NaiveBayes_weighted              0.475
RandomForest_nearmiss            0.513
RandomForest_smote               0.484
RandomForest_undersampled        0.544
RandomForest_weighted            0.484
SVM_nearmiss                     0.531
SVM_smote                        0.521
SVM_undersampled                 0.540
SVM_weighted                     0.519

Recommendations:
- Use SMOTE or Weighted Loss for imbalanced classification tasks.
- Consider additional metrics like precision/recall per class for deeper insight.
